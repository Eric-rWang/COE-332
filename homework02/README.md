## General info
Animals Json-Parser can generate random animal json files  with generate_animals.py and parse through them using read_animals. The file generate_animals.py will output a json file containing 20 animals with randomly generated attibutes. The read-animals.py file can parse through the animals json file and has the function breed(parent1, parent2) which takes properties from both parents and combines them, making a child. Lastly, test_read_animals.py tests the functions which breed uses.
